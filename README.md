## Web3 with React and Vite 

App is using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and  [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 
Using the two in conjunction is probably one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

Intend on making this my boilerplate for web3 apps. The app uses

- **[Raibowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)**, the best auth for web3
- **[Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)**, react hooks for web3 on Ethereum
- **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)**
- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/)**, just trying to avoid design

### Getting Started
- `npm install` all dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start vite and watch the HMR do wonders.
